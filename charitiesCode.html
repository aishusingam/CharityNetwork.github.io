<div class="header">Water</div>

<div>
	Although clean water may not seem like a challenge to most people, many people, mainly girls and women, in third world countries have to travel over 20 miles to find water for their homes. Often, they spend hours trying to find this water which is usually very unclean. So, most of these girls' time is spent finding water so they don't have time to go to school and move up in the world so they are stuck in this cycle. So, to help these people get the clean water they deserve as human beings, try to donate at the below links.

<div>

	Education is a basic necesity in today's world, but many children are deprived of this right because their families cannot afford it. These children often stay at home and do chores which causes low literacy rates in many nations. In addition, this significantly lower these children's chances at finding well paying jobs and therefore `hindering their chance at success in the future. Donate today to help these children have a better tomorrow!
